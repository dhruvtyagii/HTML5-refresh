How Does the Internet Work: A Step-by-Step Pictorial
May 24, 2019
As you’re reading this article, you’re contributing to history. Over the last fifty years, technology and the functionality of the internet have transformed to become the convenient systems we use in our daily lives.
But as you might have guessed, the internet didn’t always look this way, nor was it so popular. In fact, in the year 2000, only 52% of US adults said they used the internet; but in 2018, that number jumped to 82% [1].

From the query that got you here in the first place: “how does the internet work?” to shopping online and communicating with family and friends, the internet has completely changed the way we live, collaborate, and learn. But where did this all get started? And how did the internet evolve into the ubiquitous system we know it as today?
The internet plays a significant role in our daily lives
In the year 2000, only 52% of US adults used the internet [1]
In 2018, that number jumped to 89%
In 2013, US adults who didn’t use broadband internet at home but owned smartphones was just 8%
In 2018, that number increased to 20%

To fully understand how the internet works and how we got here, we’ll need to start from the beginning.
A Brief History of the Internet
On October 29, 1969, an organization called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency) launched the first iteration of the internet (also known as ARPANET) connecting four major computers at The University of Utah, UCSB, UCLA, and Stanford Research Institute [2].
When this network of computers was connected, universities were able to access files and transmit information from one organization to the other, as well as internally.
As researchers developed the system, they continued to connect computers from other universities, including MIT, Harvard, and Carnegie Mellon. Eventually, ARPANET was renamed “internet.”
Who used the internet in this stage?
In its earliest days, the internet was only used by computer experts, scientists, engineers, and librarians who had to learn a complicated system in order to use it, but as the technology improved and consumers adapted, it became an essential tool for people around the globe.
How and when did the functionality of the internet change?
The 1970s was a serious time of transition for the internet. Email was introduced in 1972, libraries across the country were linked, and above all, information exchange became more seamless thanks to Transport Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) architecture.

The invention of these protocols helped to standardize how information was sent and received over the web, making the delivery more consistent, regardless of where or how you’re accessing the internet.
When did the internet become user-friendly?
Then in 1986, the National Science Foundation took the development of the internet to the next echelon by funding NSFNET, a network of supercomputers throughout the country.
These supercomputers laid the groundwork for personal computing, bridging the gap between computers being used exclusively for academic purposes and computers used to perform daily tasks.
In 1991, The University of Minnesota developed the first user-friendly internet interface, making it easier to access campus files and information. The University of Nevada at Reno continued to develop this usable interface, introducing searchable functions and indexing.
When did consumers begin using the internet?
As the internet’s development continued to evolve and shift focus, the National Science Foundation discontinued its sponsorship of the internet’s backbone (NSFNET) in May of 1995.
This change lifted all commercial use limitations on the internet and ultimately, allowed the internet to diversify and grow rapidly. Shortly after, AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy joined Delphi to offer commercial internet service to consumers.
The debut of WiFi and Windows 98 in the late nineties marked the tech industry’s commitment to developing the commercial element of the internet. This next step gave companies like Microsoft access to a new audience, consumers (like yourself).

What does internet usage look like today?
Flash-forward to today. It’s estimated that three billion people now use the internet, many of whom use it on a daily basis to help them get from Point A to Point B, catch up with loved ones, collaborate at work, or to learn more about important questions like how does the internet work? [3]
As technology changes and the internet weaves its way into just about every aspect of our lives, even more people are expected to use it. In 2030, researchers project there will be 7.5 billion internet users and 500 billion devices connected to the internet [4].
How does the internet work?
Now that you have some background on the evolution of the internet, let’s tackle the question at hand: “how does the internet work?”
The internet is a worldwide computer network that transmits a variety of data and media across interconnected devices. It works by using a packet routing network that follows Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP) [5].
TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, no matter which device you’re using or where you’re using it.
When data is transferred over the internet, it’s delivered in messages and packets. Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they’re broken up into tinier parts called packets.
These messages and packets travel from one source to the next using Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP). IP is a system of rules that govern how information is sent from one computer to another computer over an internet connection.
Using a numerical address (IP Address) the IP system receives further instructions on how the data should be transferred.
The Transport Control Protocol (TCP) works with IP to ensure transfer of data is dependable and reliable. This helps to make sure that no packets are lost, packets are reassembled in proper sequence, and there’s no delay negatively affecting the data quality.
