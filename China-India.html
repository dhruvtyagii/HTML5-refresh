            Growing up in India in the 21st century, it’d be more than impossible to not be exposed to Sino-India border issues. For years, whether in history books, propaganda at family dinners by the conspiracy theorist uncles who somehow found out about nehru’s chinese lineage and hence his catapulting to the ccp, or in rabid media debates that boast of banning insignificant Chinese mobile applications, we have been surrounded by noise amplified by our envy of the chinese. These are just the anecdotes that I could recall from my growing up years in the capital of India. I fell hook, line, and sinker for all the above talking points. To put things into perspective, to discern truth from fiction and hypocrisy in mainstream media, you have to peel the layers. But, when it comes to China, fiction is somewhat like a matroshka doll - you keep peeling and it’ll be more fiction and hypocrisy. 

The past few years, my short experience in Singapore and a small understanding of their economic coupling, or rather, coupled decoupling has changed my perspective toward what the future can or could’ve been for India. A measured co operation with China could’ve propelled the south asian region into a dominant force of the world, and possibly leapfrog a big part of the western world much like how the troubled ASEAN has shown the way to the world by sewing a growth story of their own. 

But, I’m not writing this article to elucidate the growth potential of a co-operative, measured, free trade-enabled India china partnership that can shake the foundations of the world. My sole purpose behind writing this is to strengthen my prose and give a clearer idea of the sino-india border issue beyond the matroshka dolls. To keep my understanding of the sino-border issue succinct and as factual as possible - I have decided to mostly refer to the exchange between Prime Minister Nehru and the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. 

To put things into perspective, the Sino-Indian border has 3 fronts - The western (left of nepal) , sikkim, and the eastern (right of bhutan). 

India’s border claim on the western front dates back to 1865, when the British civil servant WH Johnson drew the Johnson line, granting large swaths of land in the Aksai Chin area to the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. Since the chinese were occupied with the Duhang revolt under the Qin dynasty, Xinjiang was akin to a chaotic unadministered hinterland and the british didn’t consider it to be under Chinese control. 

By the late 1800s, the Chinese had won back xinjiang and had started exercising control over most of the region. The maharaja’s abandoned fort at Xaidulla was taken over and the chinese established a small but temporary outpost in the region. China had also started demarcating the border near the karakoram pass by the turn of the century
